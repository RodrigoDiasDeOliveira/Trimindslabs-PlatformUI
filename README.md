The official Design System and Frontend Platform of Triminds.

## Overview

Triminds Platform is a shared UI ecosystem designed to accelerate the development of all Triminds products through a unified Design System, reusable components, centralized theming, and modern frontend architecture.

The platform provides:

* Consistent user experience across products
* Shared UI components
* Multi-theme support
* Accessibility-first design
* High performance and scalability
* Reduced frontend technical debt

---

## Why Triminds Platform?

After developing multiple products such as:

* Triminds Logistics Plataform
* Triminds Geo AI (Satellite Image Classification Platform)
* Triminds Trusted Search (AI Agents, RAG Systems)
* Triminds Security Layer (cybersecurity)
* Future commercial products

we identified recurring challenges:

* UI inconsistency
* Duplicate components
* Different frontend architectures
* Slow delivery of new products
* Weak brand standardization

Triminds Platform solves these issues by creating a single source of truth for frontend development.

## Core Principles

### Design System First

Every component follows a centralized design language.

### Composition over Configuration

Small reusable primitives compose complex interfaces.

### Accessibility by Default

Built on Radix UI primitives.

### Type Safety

Strict TypeScript typing.

### Performance

* Tree shaking
* Code splitting
* Optimized bundles
* Vite library mode

### Multi-product Theming

Support for independent themes:

* Logistics
* Security
* RAG system
* Future Triminds products

## Documentation

The ADRs record decisions and target architecture; they do not by themselves prove that every package, state-management layer, router, plugin or tenant runtime is implemented. See the [Platform UI ADR-to-implementation evidence review](docs/platform-ui-adr-implementation-evidence-2026-10-11.md) for the source-level matrix and current workspace/CI boundaries.
